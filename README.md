This small project is meant to allow you to draw on an existing image and create a .blk file for war thunder sight.

There are 3 python files in the folder:

Make sure to install all the requirements in the "requirements.txt" file
Python is relatively easy so feel free to learn it or just use ChatGPT to help you if you dont have experience with it

# draw_sight.py:
This is the main program where you can draw on an existing image. Just download all the requirements in the "requirements.txt" file and run the script
There should be instructions when the program run

# scale_img.py:
This is for scaling the image up or down in case you accidentally make the sight too big or too small. I didnt make a GUI for this script so you
have to edit the varibles (inputfilepath, outputfilepath, scale) at the bottom of the script to run

# visualize.py:
This is for testing if the .blk you just made works or not. Edit the filepath in the script and run to see if the .blk sight is correct
